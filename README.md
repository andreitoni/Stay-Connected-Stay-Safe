# Stay-Connected-Stay-Safe
An Android Application designed to enhance the safety of those who use it by presenting real-time user location information to connected persons on a map.

Features:

The user is able to log in to the application and see the connected users on the map.

The app tracks the userâ€™s location on a map as well as the places they visit and stores them for later access.

When two or more users connect through the app, they will be able to track all the information the other provides.

Alert functionality: when facing an emergency, the person in danger will only have to press a panic button and all the paired users will be instantly alerted to connect and provide immediate help.

The paired user will be able to see the battery level of the other user. This feature is beneficial because in the case that a user has only 2 or 3% battery, the other user will know and can contact them as soon as possible to alert them to charge their phone.
